## Exercise 1: Configuring Azure AD Connect with AD DS

Duration:  60 minutes

In this exercise, you will be configuring [Azure AD Connect](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/whatis-azure-ad-connect). With Azure Virtual Desktop, all session host VMs within the AVD tenant environment are required to be domain joined to AD DS, and the domain must be synchronized with Azure AD. To manage the synchronization of objects, you will configure Azure AD Connect on the domain controller deployed in Azure.

>**Note**: RDP access to a domain controller using a public IP address is not a best practice and is only done to simplify this lab. Better security practices such as removing the PIP, enabling just-in-time access and/or leveraging a bastion host should be applied enhance security.

### Task 1: Connecting to the domain controller

1.  In Azure portal, click on **Resource groups** in the **Navigate** section.

    ![](media/resourcegroup.png)

2. On the Resource Group page, open **AVD-RG** and locate the resource named **AdPubIP1** that is a Public IP address.

    ![](media/resource.png)
    
3. Copy the IP address given in the right side to a safe location such as in a text editor.

    ![This image shows how to find the public IP address for the domain controller VM.](media/publicip.png "Public IP address for Domain Controller VM")

5.  On your local machine, open the **RUN** dialog window, type **MSTSC** and enter.

    ![This image shows the Run dialog window to run MSTSC.](media/run.png "Run on Windows") 

6.  In the **Remote Desktop Connection** window, paste in the public IP address from the previous step and click on **Connect**.

    ![This image shows how the Window for Remote Desktop Connection will open to enter the public IP address for the domain controller VM.](media/remoteDesktop.png "Window for Remote Desktop Connection") 

7.  When prompted, sign in using the following credentials:

  * Username: **CONTOSO.COM\ADadmin****
  * Password: **WVD\@zureL\@b2019!**
  * When prompted, select **Yes** to accept the RDP certification warning.


### Task 2: Disabling IE Enhanced Security

To simplify tasks in this lab, we will start by disabling [IE Enhanced Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/customize/desktop/unattend/microsoft-windows-ie-esc).

1.  Once connected to the domain controller, open Server Manager if it does not start automatically.

2.  In Server Manager, select **Local Server** on the left.

    ![](media/localServer.png)

3.  Locate the **IE Enhanced Security Configuration** option and select **On**.

    ![This image shows the Local Server properties in server manager, locate Enhanced Security configuration.](media/IEESC.png "Local Server properties within server manager") 

4.  On the Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration window, under **Administrators**, select the **Off** radio button and select **OK**.

    ![This image shows how you select the current configuration, a new window will open that will allow you to disable the enhanced security configuration.](media/disablesecurity.png "Disable enhanced security configuration")

### Task 3: Creating a domain admin account

By default, Azure AD Connect does not synchronize the built-in domain administrator account [ADAdmin\@MyADDomain.com](mailto:ADAdmin@MyADDomain.com). This system account has the attribute isCriticalSystemObject set to *true*, preventing it from being synchronized. While it is possible to modify this, it is not a best practice to do so.

1.  In Server Manager, select **Tools** in the upper right corner and select **Active Directory Users and Computers**.

    ![This image shows how to find Tools on the upper right corner to access the Server Manager Tools.](media/serverMangerTools.png "Server Manager Tools") 

2.  In Active Directory Users and Computers, right-click the **Users** organization unit and select **New \> User** from the menu.

    ![In this image, you find the folder path for users, and right-click to add a new user.](media/newUser.png "Folder path for new user") 

3.  Complete the New User wizard.

    ![This image shows the window that will open with the fields to complete for a new user.](media/newuserobject.png "Create a new user")

    ![This image is the next window that will allow you to assign a password.](media/newUserWizard.png "New User Wizard window") 

    ![This image shows the final screen of the wizard will allow you to review and finish the new user setup.](media/finishnewuser.png "Finish new user setup")

    >**Note**: This account will be important in future tasks. Make a note of the username and password you create. When setting the password, uncheck the box **User must change password at next logon**.

4. In Active Directory Users and Computers, double-click on **Users** and scroll down to the new user **wvd admin**.

    ![](media/userwvdadmin.png "Add new user to a group")

5.  Now right-click on the **wvd admin** user account and select **Add to a group**.

    ![This image shows when the new user is created, we will find that username and right-click to add the user to a group.](media/addusertogroup.png "Add new user to a group")

6.  On the Select Groups dialog window, type **Domain Admins**, then select **Check Names** and select **OK**.

    ![This image shows how we will add this user to the Domain Admins group.](media/addusertodomainadmins.png "Add user to Domain Admins group")

> **Note**: This account will be used during the host pool creation process for joining the hosts to the domain. Granting Domain Admin permissions will simplify the lab. However, any Active Directory account that has the following permissions will suffice. This can be done using [Active Directory Delegate Control](https://danielengberg.com/domain-join-permissions-delegate-active-directory/). 
 
7. Select **OK** on thw popup saying **The Add to Group  operation was successfully completed**.

### Task 4: Configuring Azure AD Connect

1.  On the desktop of the domain controller, locate the icon for **Azure AD Connect** and open it.

    ![This image shows the Azure AD Connect icon on the Domain controller VM desktop.](media/azureadconnect.png "Azure AD Connect desktop icon")

2.  Accept the license terms and privacy notice by selecting the check box and then select **Continue**. 

    ![](media/accept.png "Add user to Domain Admins group")

3.  On the next screen select **Use express settings**. The required components will install.

    ![This image shows how the install wizard will take you to the Azure AD connect set up screen.](media/AzureADconnectExpressSetting.png "Azure AD connect set up screen") 

4.  On the Connect to Azure AD page, enter in the Azure AD Global Admin credentials. 
  * Username: **<inject key="AzureAdUserEmail" />**
  * Password: **<inject key="AzureAdUserPassword" />**
  
    ![This image shows how after selecting "Use express settings", the next window will require you to enter your Azure Active Directory username and password.](media/adconnectazuresub.png "Azure AD Connect - Azure AD login")

> **Note**: This is the account associated with your Azure subscription.

5.  On the Connect to AD DS page, enter the Active Directory credentials given below for the Domain Admin account and then select **Next**:
  * Username: **CONTOSO.COM\ADadmin**
  * Password: **WVD@zureL@b2019!**

    ![This image shows the next window, where you will enter the AD DS domain and admin username and password.](media/azureadconnectdclogin.png "Azure AD Connect - Domain login")
    
> **Note**: When you copy and paste the password, make sure there are no trailing spaces, as that will cause the verification to fail.

6. Select the checkbox saying **Continue without matching all UPN suffixes to verified domains**.

    ![](media/continue.png "Add user to Domain Admins group")

7.  Select **Install** to start the configuration and synchronization.

    ![This image shows the next window, where you will select the box to continue without matching all UPN suffixes and select next to continue.](media/azureadsigninconfig.png "Azure AD sign-in configuration")

    ![This image shows the final setup window, select the box to start the synchronization process and select install.](media/azureadready.png "Azure AD Connect Ready to configure")

8.  After a few minutes, the Azure AD Connect installation will complete. Select **Exit**.

    ![This image shows the installation is complete the Configuration complete window will be present.](media/AADCcomplete.png "The Configuration is completed window")
    
9.  Minimize the RDP session for the domain controller and wait a few minutes for the AD accounts to be synchronized to Azure AD.

10. Navigate to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/). Type _Azure Active Directory_ in the search field and select **Azure Active Directory** from the list.

11. On the Azure Active Directory blade, under **Manage**, select **Users**.

    ![](media/aadusers.png "Add user to Domain Admins group")

12. Review the list of user account objects and confirm the test accounts have synchronized.

    ![This image shows the list of users that you should see in Azure Active Directory that were synchronized from Active Directory with Azure AD Connect.](media/adconnectsync.png "Synchronized users list")

    >**Note**: It can take up to 15 minutes for the Active Directory objects to be synchronized to the Azure AD tenant.

13. Click on the **Next** button present in the bottom-right corner of this lab guide.

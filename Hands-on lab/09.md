### Task 1: Enabling Autoscale

In this task, you will create an Azure Automation account and Logic App that will regularly update the scaling of your pool based on the number of connections.  Azure Automation allows for the execution of scripts and commands with an identity related to the automation.  Logic App allows for regular execution of commands and tasks.  By combining these two resources, we allow for repetitive tasks of a detailed nature which will allow us to automatically increase and decrease the number of hosts in an AVD host pool based on demand of the environment.

1. Use PowerShell on a system with the [Azure Module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps?view=azps-5.9.0) installed (such as from Exercise 3, Task 3).

2. Run the following command connect to Azure using the subscription of your AVD:

    ```powershell
    Connect-AzAccount
    ```

3.  Use the following commands to download installation script for the Automation Account:

    ```powershell
    New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path ".\AVDTemp" -Force
    Set-Location -Path ".\AVDTemp"
    $Uri = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/RDS-Templates/master/wvd-templates/wvd-scaling-script/CreateOrUpdateAzAutoAccount.ps1"
    # Download the script
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $Uri -OutFile ".\CreateOrUpdateAzAutoAccount.ps1"
    ```

4. Use the following to call the installation script with the appropriate parameters:

    ```powershell
    $LAWorkspace = Get-AzOperationalInsightsWorkspace | ?{ $_.name -notlike "DefaultWork*" }
    $Params = @{
        "UseARMAPI"             = $true
        "Location"              = $LAWorkspace.location
        "WorkspaceName"         = $LAWorkspace.name       # Optional. If specified, Log Analytics will be used to configure the custom log table that the runbook PowerShell script can send logs to
    }

    .\CreateOrUpdateAzAutoAccount.ps1 @Params

    ```

5. Now that the Azure Automation account is created, keep the PowerShell window open in the background and go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) in your browser to finish the setup.

    ![This image shows the return to the Azure Portal web page.](images/azureportal.png "Azure Portal")

6. Go to the Azure Automation account.

    ![This image shows where to search to find the Azure Automation account in the portal.](images/automationAccount.png "Azure Portal")

7. Select Run As accounts under Account Settings.

8. Select **Create** to create a new account.

    ![This image shows where you will find the automation account and select Run As of the Automation Account.](images/createRunAs.png "Create Automation Run As Account")

  >**Note**: This process may take a few minutes, but you can track the progress.

9. When it is complete, there will be a resource named **AzureRunAsConnection**.

10. Selecting the **Azure Run As account**, you can see the application ID, tenant ID, subscription ID, and certificate thumbprint.

    ![This image shows the completed Run As Automation account.](images/AutomationRunAsDetails.png "Azure automation Run As account")

11. Go back to the PowerShell window from earlier.

12. Run the following code to download a script to create the Logic App:

    ```powershell
    $Uri = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/RDS-Templates/master/wvd-templates/wvd-scaling-script/CreateOrUpdateAzLogicApp.ps1"
    # Download the script
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $Uri -OutFile ".\CreateOrUpdateAzLogicApp.ps1"
    ```

13. Run the following code to use the script to create your Logic App:

    ```powershell
    $AADTenantId = (Get-AzContext).Tenant.Id

    $AzSubscription = (Get-AzContext).Subscription

    $ResourceGroup = Get-AzResourceGroup  "AVDAutoScaleResourceGroup"

    $AVDHostPool = Get-AzWvdHostPool | ?{ $_.HostPoolType -eq "Pooled" } | Select -First 1 | Get-AzResource

    $LogAnalyticsWorkspaceId = $LAWorkspace.CustomerId.Guid
    $LogAnalyticsPrimaryKey =  ($LAWorkspace | Get-AzOperationalInsightsWorkspaceSharedKey).PrimarySharedKey
    $RecurrenceInterval = 15
    $BeginPeakTime = "09:00"
    $EndPeakTime = "18:00"
    $TimeDifference = "-7:00"
    $SessionThresholdPerCPU = 2 #this number is abnormally low for the lab; this is not what you would use in most production environments
    $MinimumNumberOfRDSH = 1
    $MaintenanceTagName = "NoScaling"
    $LimitSecondsToForceLogOffUser = 1 #this number is abnormally low for the lab; this is not what you would use in most production environments
    $LogOffMessageTitle = "Automation Log Off for Scaling"
    $LogOffMessageBody = "To improve resource utilization we need to move your session to a new host. Please save your work and log back in to AVD continue working on a new host. For assistance, please contact the Help Desk."

    $AutoAccount =  Get-AzAutomationAccount -Name "AVDAutoScaleAutomationAccount" -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroup.ResourceGroupName
    $AutoAccountConnection = Get-AzAutomationConnection -ResourceGroupName $AutoAccount.ResourceGroupName -AutomationAccountName $AutoAccount.AutomationAccountName | Select -first 1

    $WebhookURIAutoVar = Get-AzAutomationVariable -Name 'WebhookURIARMBased' -ResourceGroupName $AutoAccount.ResourceGroupName -AutomationAccountName $AutoAccount.AutomationAccountName

    $Params = @{
        "AADTenantId"                   = $AADTenantId                             # Optional. If not specified, it will use the current Azure context

        "UseARMAPI"                     = $true
        "HostPoolName"                  = $AVDHostPool.Name
        "HostPoolResourceGroupName"     = $AVDHostPool.ResourceGroupName           # Optional. Default: same as ResourceGroupName param value
        "LogAnalyticsWorkspaceId"       = $LogAnalyticsWorkspaceId                 # Optional. If not specified, script will not log to the Log Analytics
        "LogAnalyticsPrimaryKey"        = $LogAnalyticsPrimaryKey                  # Optional. If not specified, script will not log to the Log Analytics
        "ConnectionAssetName"           = $AutoAccountConnection.Name              # Optional. Default: "AzureRunAsConnection"
        "RecurrenceInterval"            = $RecurrenceInterval                      # Optional. Default: 15
        "BeginPeakTime"                 = $BeginPeakTime                           # Optional. Default: "09:00"
        "EndPeakTime"                   = $EndPeakTime                             # Optional. Default: "17:00"
        "TimeDifference"                = $TimeDifference                          # Optional. Default: "-7:00"
        "SessionThresholdPerCPU"        = $SessionThresholdPerCPU                  # Optional. Default: 1
        "MinimumNumberOfRDSH"           = $MinimumNumberOfRDSH                     # Optional. Default: 1
        "MaintenanceTagName"            = $MaintenanceTagName                      # Optional.
        "LimitSecondsToForceLogOffUser" = $LimitSecondsToForceLogOffUser           # Optional. Default: 1
        "LogOffMessageTitle"            = $LogOffMessageTitle                      # Optional. Default: "Machine is about to shutdown."

        "WebhookURI"                    = $WebhookURIAutoVar.Value
    }

    .\CreateOrUpdateAzLogicApp.ps1 @Params
    ```

14. After this script completes, go back to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

    ![This image shows the Azure Portal home web page.](images/azureportal.png "Azure Portal")

15. Find the Logic App that was created by the script.

    ![This image shows the search to access Azure Portal Logic App services.](images/logicApps.png "Azure Portal")

16. Select the **Logic app designer** link under Development Tools, you will see the graphical representation of the workflow created by the script.

17. You can select **Recurrence** to change how often the script runs.

18. Select the **Run** button to trigger the scaling immediately.

    ![This image shows the Logic App graphical design view.](images/logicAppDesigner.png "Logic App Designer")

19. View the occurrences of your runs by going back to the **Overview** of the Logic App.

    ![This image shows the opening of the Logic App overview that will show the Run History and see previous runs.](images/logicAppOverview.png "Logic App Overview")

At this point, your AVD Host Pool that is Pooled will spin up and down hosts based on the load of the environment.

### Task 2: Utilizing Application Packages (MSIX)

In this task, you will take a **MSIX package** created from the [MSIX packaging tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/msix/packaging-tool/tool-overview) and utilize the Azure portal to attach the MSIX package dynamically to AVD pools as users login.  MSIX Packages are disk images containing all files, configurations, and publication details needed to run supported applications that can be mounted by Windows systems on the fly to allow users to run the application without having to install the application to the host machine. By utilizing this technique, we can minimize the footprint and management needs of the AVD hosts while still utilizing multiple applications on the systems without installing the applications permanent on the system.

1. Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

    ![This image shows the Azure Portal home web page.](images/azureportal.png "Azure Portal")

2. Go to the **Storage Account** created in Exercise 3 for the FSLogix profiles that was already joined to Active Directory.

3. Select the **File shares** under data storage and select the share created for AVD files.

    ![This image shows that you will open share for AVD File Share on storage account.](images/avdFileShare.png "AVD File Share")

4. Select the **+ Add directory** button to create a new folder and name it **msix**.

    ![This image shows where to add a directory on storage account.](images/avdFileShareAdd.png "File Share add directory")

    > **Note:** Normally in production you would create an additional share for MSIX files and place the files there.  You would need to make sure the share or container the MSIX files are in you follow the same steps you use for the FSLogix storage account and apply the appropriate permissions to them (users normally only need Read access) and make sure there is enough room to store them.  We are placing it on the same share for this exercise for expediency sake and easier setup. It is not uncommon to have a central MSIX storage with permissions to each MSIX file based on groups assigned to the appropriate application and the MSIX repository used by multiple pools or deployments, but ensure network connectivity and speed are kept consistent.

5. Take note of the storage account (i.e.: `dncloudavdstorage` ) and the name of the file share (i.e.: `labavdfileshare`).

6. Open a PowerShell window with the Azure Module installed and connect to the Azure subscription with this command if it is not already connected:

    ```powershell
    Connect-AzAccount
    ```

7. Run this command to upload the MSIX file to the folder:

    ```powershell
    $SAName = Read-Host "What is the name of the storage account with AVD file shares? (ie: mystorageacct1592)" # Provide the name to the storage account here instead of prompting
    $SAShare = Read-Host "What is the name of the file share in the storage account used for AVD? (ie: labavdfilesshare)"

    $sa = Get-AzStorageAccount | ? StorageAccountName -eq $SAName
    $SAS = New-AzStorageAccountSASToken -Context $sa.Context -Service File -ResourceType Object -Permission rwd -Protocol HttpsOnly -ExpiryTime ((Get-Date).AddHours(4))

    .\azcopy.exe copy 'https://openhackpublic.blob.core.windows.net/windows-virtual-desktop/msix/MCW-WVD-MSIX.vhd' "https://$($sa.StorageAccountName).file.core.windows.net/$SAShare/msix/MCW-WVD-MSIX.vhd$SAS"

    "\\$($sa.StorageAccountName).file.core.windows.net\$SAShare\msix\MCW-WVD-MSIX.vhd" | scb
    Write-Output "Use the path [\\$($sa.StorageAccountName).file.core.windows.net\$SAShare\msix\MCW-WVD-MSIX.vhd] later in this exercise"
    pause
    ```

8. Find the **Windows Virtual Desktop** resources.

9. Select the **Host pools** and select the Pooled host pool.

    ![This image shows the selecting Host Pools of Azure Virtual Desktop.](images/avdHostPools.png "AVD Host Pools")

10. Select the **Pooled** host pool.

    ![This image shows the selecting Pooled host pools of Azure Virtual Desktop.](images/avdPooledPool.png "Pooled host pool")

11. Go to  **MSIX packages** under the Manage section and select **+ Add** to add an MSIX package to the pool.

    ![This image shows where to go for the MSIX packages section and select add a package.](images/avdAddMSIXPackages.png "AVD add MSIX package")

12. In the MSIX image path, put the following path replacing `<storageacctname>` with the name over the Storage Account and `<shareName>` with the share that holds the MSIX above:

    ```markdown
    \\<storageacctname>.file.core.windows.net\<shareName>\msix\MCW-WVD-MSIX.vhd
    ``` 
    
13. Select the **MSIX Package** to add.

    ![This image shows where to select the MSIX package to add.](images/avdAddMSIXPackage.png "Add MSIX package")

14. Ensure there is an application listed under **Package applications**.

15. For **Registration type**, select **On-demand registration**.

16. Under **State**, select **Active**.

17. Select **Add** to add the package.

    ![This image shows the settings for adding application package to AVD.](images/avdAddPackageSettings.png "Add MSIX settings")

18. Go to the **Application groups** and select **remoteapps**.

    ![This image shows where to select AVD Application Group.](images/avdApplicationGroup.png "Go to Application group")

19. Select **+ Add** to add an application.

    ![This image shows where to Add Application Group.](images/avdAddApplication.png "Add application")

20. Choose **MSIX package** from the Application source.

21. Select the MSIX package and MSIX application you just added.

22. Ensure the **Application name** matches the name.

23. Select **Save** to include

    ![This image shows how to set the MSIX application settings and select Save.](images/avdSaveMSIXApp.png "Setup MSIX application")

24. Go to the [AVD Web Client](https://rdweb.wvd.microsoft.com/arm/webclient) (or AVD client if installed locally).

25. Select the new application icon to launch the application (refresh the page if the new application does not show up).

This application is now running on the host pool although the application itself is not installed to the host system.  This allows for the application to also be updated by changing which MSIX package the application points to and the next time a user logs into the application. 

### Task 3: Protect AVD with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

In this task, you will enable Microsoft Defender for Endpoint service and deploy the endpoint protection via Azure. This will allow for all systems to be protected by the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint service from potential vulnerabilities and alert in the event of suspicious execution or activity.

> **Note:** This will require signing up for [Azure Defender trial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/enable-azure-defender#to-enable-azure-defender-on-your-subscriptions-and-workspaces) on your subscription.  If this is a Visual Studio subscription or you do not want to sign up for the time trial yet, you will need to wait and deploy this when you can sign up for the Azure Defender trial.


1. Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

    ![This image shows the Azure Portal home page.](images/azureportal.png "Azure Portal")

2. Open the Azure **Security Center** (ASC) service.

    ![In this image, you are searching and navigating to Azure Security Center (ASC)](images/findAsc.png "Azure Security Center")

3. Go the **Azure Defender** under the Cloud Security section.

4. Select **Enable Azure Defender** to setup the trial edition of Azure Defender for your subscription.

    ![This image shows how to navigate to the Azure Defender section to enable the trial of Azure Defender.](images/enableAzureDefender.png "Enable Azure Defender")

5. Go back to **Azure Defender**.

6. Under the Advanced protection section, select **VM vulnerability assessment** where it lists the unprotected count of systems.

    ![This image shows how to where to select the VM assessment of Security Center to deploy to VMs.](images/defenderVMassesment.png "VM assessment")

7. Check the boxes next to all the VMs that host the AVD Host pools.

8. Select **Fix** to proceed to deployment of the agent.

    ![This image shows the VMs to choose for the hosts of the AVD and fix VMs to enable a vulnerability assessment.](images/defenderFixVMs.png "Fix defender for vulnerability assessment on AVD VMs")

9. Select the **Qualys** agent for deploying to Azure Defender and select **Proceed**.

    ![In this image, you are choosing the Qualys agent that is included with the Azure Defender for servers.](images/defenderSelectQualys.png "Choose Qualys")

10. Select **Fix X resources** to begin the deployment of the agent.

    ![This image shows the final step to ensure the VMs expected to be fixed after completing the previous steps.](images/deployDefenderByFix.png "Fix VMs with defender")

This will begin deploying Azure Defender to the Virtual Machines currently deployed.  Depending on your AVD environment, you can deploy them to systems as they are added to your domain in the AVD OU by utilizing Group Policies using the [domain group policy scenario](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/onboard-windows-10-multi-session-device?view=o365-worldwide#scenario-2-using-domain-group-policy).  Another option when your host is not persistent or deployed from an image, is to use the instructions for [onboarding non-persistent VDI devices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/configure-endpoints-vdi?view=o365-worldwide). 

11. Click on the **Next** button present in the bottom-right corner of this lab guide.

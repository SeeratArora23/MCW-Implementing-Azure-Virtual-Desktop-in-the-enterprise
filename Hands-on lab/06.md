## Exercise 6: Create a host pool and assign pooled remote apps.

Duration:  45 minutes

In this exercise, you will be creating a non-persistent host pool for publishing remote apps. This enables you to assign users access to specific applications rather than an entire desktop. This type of application deployment serves many purposes and is not new to AVD, but has existed in Windows Server Remote Desktop Services for many years.

### Task 1: Create a new host pool and workspace

1.  Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2.  Search for **Azure Virtual Desktop** and select it from the list.

6.  On the Workspace page, select **Yes** to register a new desktop app group. Select **Create new** and provide a **Workspace name**. Select **OK** and **Review + create**.

    ![This image shows where you will select yes and create a new workspace, and then select review and create when complete.](images/newworkspaceremoteapps.png "Create a new workspace")

7.  On the Create a host pool page, select **Create**.

### Task 2: Create a friendly name for the workspace

The name of the Workspace is displayed when the user signs in. Available resources are organized by Workspace. For a better user experience, we will provide a friendly name for our new Workspace.

1.  Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2.  Search for **Azure Virtual Desktop** and select it from the list.

3.  Under Manage, select **Workspaces**. Locate the Workspace that was created for remote apps and select the name.

    ![This image shows where to locate the workspace that was created in Task 1 and select it.](images/workspaceproperties.png "Locate workspace created")

4.  Under Settings, select **Properties**.

5.  Update the **Friendly name** field to your desired name.

### Task 3: Add Remote Apps to your Host Pool

1.  Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2.  Search for **Azure Virtual Desktop** and select it from the list.

3.  Under Manage, select **Host pools** and select the host pool that you created in Task 1.  Select **Application groups** and select **Add** to create a new application group.

7.  On the Add Application fly out, next to Application source, select **Start Menu**. add the following applications, selecting **Save** between selections.

    - Outlook

    - Microsoft Edge

    - Microsoft Teams

    - Word

    - PowerPoint

    - Excel

    ![This image shows the final list of applications will look like this.](images/listofapps.png "Application list")

8.  Select **Next: Assignments**.

9.  On the assignments tab, select **Add assignments**.  Search for the **AVD Remote App All Users** and **AAD DC Administrators** created earlier in this guide and choose **Select**.

    >**Note**: AAD DC Administrators will allow you to use your Azure tenant login to access resources in Exercise 7.

10.  Select **Next: Workspace**.

11. On the Workspace page, select **Yes** to register the application group.

    >**Note**: The **Register application group** field will automatically populate with the workspace name.

12. Select **Review + Create**.

    ![This image shows the workspace name will auto-populate and you will select review and create.](images/remoteappws.png "Create application group")

13. Select **Create**.

You have successfully created a Remote App non-persistent Host Pool with published apps. You can validate this configuration when you connect to the environment in a later exercise.

14. Click on the **Next** button present in the bottom-right corner of this lab guide.

## Exercise 4: Create a gold image for AVD

Duration:  90 minutes

In this exercise, you are going to walk through the process of creating a gold image for your AVD host pools. The basic concept for a gold image is to start with a clean base install of Windows and layer on mandatory updates, applications, and configurations. There are many ways to create and manage images for AVD. The steps covered in this exercise are going to walk you through a basic build and capture process that includes core applications and recommended configuration options for AVD.

### Task 1: Create a new Virtual Machine (VM) in Azure

1.  On the Azure portal home page, select **Create a resource**.

2.  On the New page, search for **Microsoft Windows 10**. Select **Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session, Version 1909** and **Create**.


    ![This image shows the window will display the creation of a New Microsoft Windows 10 VM using software plan Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session, Version 1909.](images/windows10VM.png "New Microsoft Windows 10 VM using software plan Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session, Version 1909")

    >**Note**: In this exercise we are selecting a base Windows 10 image to start with and installing Office 365 ProPlus using a custom deployment script. We are also using the latest available release of Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session, but you can choose the version based on your requirements.

4.  On the Create a virtual machine page, fill in the required fields and create the VM by selecting **Review + create**.

    ![This image shows what your configuration should be for the virtual machine image.](images/win10vmcreate.png "Create virtual machine")

    >**Note**: Make a note of the **Username** and **Password** used to create the VM. This information will be required to access the VM after creation.

    >**Note**: This guide does not walk through the process of creating a VM in Azure. However, for **Inbound port rules**, be sure to allow **RDP (3389)**, or have a bastion host deployed for remote access.

    ![This image shows that, in the "Create a virtual machine" page within the Azure portal for the Windows 10 VM, allow port 3389 as an inbound port.](images/windows10VMcreate.png "The 'Create a virtual machine' page within the Azure portal for the Windows 10 VM")

5.  Once the VM is successfully deployed, go to the resource, and connect using RDP. Sign in using the credentials you supplied when creating the VM.

    ![This image shows the select connect in the Windows 10 VM overview to RDP to the vm.](images/connectwin10vm.png)

6.  Download the RDP file and open the RDP file to connect.

    ![This image shows the download RDP button and the file that is downloaded to connect to the vm.](images/connectrdp.png)

### Task 2: Run Windows Update

Despite the Azure support teams best efforts, the Marketplace images are not always up to date. The best and most secure practice is to keep your gold image up to date.

1.  From your gold image VM, open the **Settings** app and select **Updates & Security**.

    ![This image shows that, on the new Windows 10 VM image, go to settings window and select update and security.](images/w10VMSettings.png "The settings window within the Windows 10 VM")

2.  Install all missing updates, rebooting as necessary.

3.  Once the VM is fully patched, the Windows Update Settings page should resemble the following screenshot.

    ![This image shows that, after checking for and running any updates, the settings window showing that Windows update is up to date.](images/w10vmSettingsUpToDate.png "The settings window showing that Windows update is up to date")

### Task 3: Prepare an AVD image

**Introduction to the script**

The authors for this content have developed a scripted solution to assist in automating some common baseline image build tasks. The script includes a UI form, enabling you to quickly select which actions to perform. The result will be a custom gold image that incorporates Microsoft's main business applications, along with the necessary
policies and settings for an optimized user experience.

The script and related tools are maintained in GitHub - [Download Link](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/shawntmeyer/WVD/tree/master/Image-Build/Customizations) 

https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/shawntmeyer/WVD/tree/master/Image-Build/Customizations 

For additional documentation about the script (e.g., parameters, functions, etc.), refer to the comments in **Prepare-WVDImage.ps1**.

For troubleshooting script execution, refer to the following log directory on the target machine: **C:\\Windows\\Logs\\ImagePrep**.

This script leverages the [Local Group Policy Object (LGPO)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-compliance-toolkit-10#what-is-the-local-group-policy-object-lgpo-tool) tool in the [Microsoft Security Compliance Toolkit (SCT)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-compliance-toolkit-10) to apply settings in the image. The settings are documented and exported on the target machine under **C:\\Windows\\Logs\\ImagePrep\\LGPO**. This approach was taken to simplify troubleshooting, enabling you to leverage Group Policy Results.

The UI form offers the following actions:

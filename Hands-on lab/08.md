## Exercise 8: Setup monitoring for AVD

Duration:  45 minutes

In this exercise, you will setup monitoring for our AVD host pools. There are multiple reasons why monitoring serves a critical role: troubleshooting, performance, security, etc. There are also multiple components that make up the AVD service, which can add some variation on how customers implement monitoring (e.g., adding additional third-party solutions). By the end of this exercise, you will have the following monitoring capabilities enabled:

-   Diagnostic logging for the AVD service

-   Azure Monitor for the session host VMs

-   Log Analytics Monitoring Agent for the session host VMs

### Task 1: Create a Log Analytics workspace

A Log Analytics workspace is required for each of the monitoring capabilities covered in this exercise. You have the option to stream log data into different workspaces if desired. There are several factors to consider around a single workspace versus multiple. For example, RBAC controls, query performance, report development, etc. For AVD
environments, it is common to have all monitor data pointing to a single dedicated workspace.

In this exercise we will create a dedicated workspace for our environment. When you already have a workspace created, move on to Task 2.

1.  Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2.  At the top of the page, in the **Search resources** field, type \"**log analytics**\". Select **Log Analytics workspaces** from the list.

    ![This image shows how to search for log analytics and select the service from the Azure Portal search bar.](images/searchloganalytics.png "Search for Log Analytics")

3.  On the Log Analytics workspaces blade, select **+Add**.

    ![This image shows how within the Log Analytics blade, you will select add to create a new workspace.](images/createlogworkspace.png "Add a Log Analytics workspace")

4.  On the Create Log Analytics workspace blade, fill in the following information and select **Review + Create**.

    -    **Subscription:** Select the desired subscription for the Log Analytics workspace.

    -    **Resource Group:** Create a new resource group or select one from the list.

    -    **Name:** Enter a unique name for the workspace.

    -    **Region:** Select a region for the workspace.

5.  Select **Create**.

    ![This image shows how to select a resource group and enter a unique name for the Log Analytics workspace.](images/configlogworkspace.png "Configure the Log Analytics workspace")

Monitor the notification bell in the upper-right corner and wait for the deployment to complete. Once complete, move on to task 2.

### Task 2: Enabling diagnostic logging for AVD

Like many other Azure services, AVD uses Azure Monitor for monitoring and alerts. To enable diagnostic data collection, you need to enable it for each ARM object that you want to monitor (e.g., Host pools, Application groups, and Workspaces). Once enabled, it can take a few hours for the data to appear in your workspace.

Each AVD ARM object has different diagnostic data categories available. For example, host pool objects will have a different set of options then Workspaces. Refer to the following table for a summary of each data category and their associated objects.

  |              |            |     |
|----------|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| **Category**  |**Description**  |                                                                 **ARM Object(s)** |
  Checkpoint   |       Specific steps in the lifetime of an activity that were reached. For example, during a session, a user was load balanced to a particular host, then the user was signed on during a connection, and so on. |  Host pools, Application groups, Workspaces
  Connection    |      When users initiate and complete connections to the service.    |                                                                                                                                             Host pools
  Error       |        Are users encountering any issues with specific activities? This feature can generate a table that tracks activity data for you if the information is joined with the activities.     |               Host pools, Application groups, Workspaces |
  Feed   |             Can users successfully subscribe to workspaces? Do users see all resources published in the Remote Desktop client?      |                                                                                     Workspaces |
  Host Registration  | Was the session host successfully registered with the service upon connecting?       |                                                                                 Host pools| 
  Management     |     Track whether attempts to change Azure Virtual Desktop objects using APIs or PowerShell are successful. For example, can someone successfully create a host pool using PowerShell?       |                  Host pools, Application groups, Workspaces

### Task 6: Enabling Azure Monitor for the session hosts

Azure Monitor is leveraged with AVD to monitor the performance and health of your session host VMs. This feature can be enabled for Azure VMs in several ways. In this exercise we will walk through enabling Azure Monitor on VMs using the Azure portal. Refer to the following links for guidance on automation.


1.  Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2.  At the top of the page, in the **Search resources** field, type \"**virtual machines**\". Select **Virtual Machines** from the list.

    ![This image shows how to access Azure Virtual Desktop from the Azure portal search bar.](images/searchvm.png "Search for Virtual machines")

3.  On the Virtual Machines blade, locate a session host VM and select the name.

4.  On the blade for the virtual machine, under **Monitoring**, select **Insights**.

    ![This image shows that from the domain controller VM, you will select insights under monitoring in the menu.](images/vminsights.png "Virtual Machine Insights")

5.  On the Insights blade, select **Enable**. This will initiate a validation check.

    ![This image shows the insights blade, where you will select enable to enable insights on the virtual machine.](images/enableinsights.png "Enable VM Insights")

    >**Note**: The virtual machine must be running to enable Azure Monitor.

6.  On the Insights setup page, fill in the following information and select **Enable**.

    -    **Workspace Subscription:** Select the desired subscription.

    -    **Choose a Log Analytics Workspace:** Select the workspace used in the previous task.

    ![This image shows the enable insights blade, where you will select the Log Analytics workspace and select enable.](images/vminsightsconfig.png "Log Analytics workspace configuration for VM Insights")

Monitor the notification bell in the upper-right corner and wait for the deployment to complete. This can take 5-10 minutes. Once complete, you will see the following items configured on the VM:

**New VM Extensions Added**. Two new extensions are added to the VM Extensions blade in Azure.

**New Monitoring Agents Installed**. Two new agents are installed on the VM.

**Monitoring Agent Configured for Log Analytics** The Microsoft Monitoring Agent is configured for your log analytics workspace.

At this point you should have Azure Monitor enabled on at least one session host VM. To enable Azure Monitor for additional session hosts, repeat the above steps. For automation, leverage Azure Policy or PowerShell to enable monitoring on multiple VMs.

**Example Kusto Queries**

For a list of example queries, refer to the following Docs article:

[**Use Log Analytics for the diagnostics feature \| Example queries**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/diagnostics-log-analytics#example-queries) 

**Troubleshooting**

- Go to your Log Analytics workspace, and then select **Logs**. The example query UI is shown automatically.
- Change the filter to **Category**.
- Select **Azure Virtual Desktop** to review available queries.
- Select **Run** to run the selected query.

Often during the deployment of AVD there may be challenges with either having machines join the domain or installing the agent via automation.
